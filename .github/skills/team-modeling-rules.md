# team-modeling-rules

Quality assessment for Power BI semantic models using prioritized structured rules. Autonomously evaluates model health and generates prioritized, actionable recommendations.

## Rules

### Critical

- Schema design should follow star-schema: Fact/dimension separation, dedicated Date table, no snowflaking, minimal calculated tables
- Explicit measures enforced for all aggregatable numeric columns, and base column should be hidden
- Measure should include a `formatString` definition
- Columns should include appropriate summarizeBy settings (e.g. Quantity > Sum; Stock Qty > Max), hidden foreign keys, no accidental aggregation
- Repeated DAX patterns should be centralized using DAX UDF functions.
  
### Important

- Model object clarity and documentation coverage: measures, columns and tables should include a business friendly description. Incorporate business verbiage of the COMPANY in the descriptions. (See [COMPANY verbiage](#company-verbiage))
- When using Power Query code data source references (e.g. Server; Folder) should be configured as a semantic model parameter
- Review modeling naming convention for consistency, if inconsistent or creating a new model use the [Naming Conventions](#naming-conventions)
- When using Web.Contents PowerQuery connector consider using the RelativePath to avoid configuring multiple connections
  ```powerquery
    Web.Contents(
        "https://baseurl",
        [
            RelativePath = "relative-path"            
        ]
    )
  ```
### Nice to Have

- Model shall include an `About` table that describes the Author and version of the model. See [About](#about-table) for details of how to create the table if not exists.

## Naming Conventions

- Tables: business-friendly names, don't use terms as 'Fact' or 'Dim', use plural names for fact tables and singular names for dimension tables (e.g. `Sales`, `Product`, `Customer`). 
- Columns: Readable names with spaces (e.g. `Order Date`, `Product`, `Unit Price`)
- Columns: For dimension name prefer a column with the same name of the dimension. `Product` instead of `Product Name`
- Measures: clear naming patterns (`Total Sales`, `Total Quantity`, `# Customers`, `# Products`)
- Measures variations (e.g. time intelligence) should follow a consistent naming convention:
  - [measure name] for base measure
  - [measure name (ly)] for last year value of the base measure
  - [measure name (ytd)] for ytd value for the base measure
- Object names must not contain tabs, line breaks, or other control characters
- Object names must not start or end with a space
- **Critical**: Always use exact case-sensitive names when referencing objects

## About table

- Create the table with columns:
  - Key: Text
  - Value: Text
  - Order: Number
- Use the following partition configuration:  
  - mode: Import
  - partition source type: m
  - M expression source:
        ```powerquery
        let
            Source = #table({ "Key", "Value" },{
                { "Developed by", "Microsoft" },
                { "Version", "1.0" },
                { "Description", "Sales.pbip" },
                { "Last Refresh", DateTime.ToText(DateTime.LocalNow(), "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss") }
            }),
            #"Added Index" = Table.AddIndexColumn(Source, "Order", 1, 1),
            #"Changed Type" = Table.TransformColumnTypes(#"Added Index",{{"Key", type text},  {"Value", type text},{"Order", Int64.Type}}),
            #"Reordered Columns" = Table.ReorderColumns(#"Changed Type",{"Key", "Value", "Order"})
        in
            #"Reordered Columns"
        ```
